      <h1>Processors</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Processors represent the brains of your PC. As a laptop user, you'll have two types of processors which are the CPU "also known as the central processing unit" and the GPU "also known as the graphics processing unit".</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">A CPU is the main processor which executes instructions in a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations specified by the instructions in the program. CPU's largest manufacturers of all time are INTEL and AMD. Recently AMD has upped their game to become more of a tough opponent to INTEL. You can learn more about CPUs <a class="hyperlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">here</a>.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">A GPU is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a <a class="hyperlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">frame buffer</a> intended for output to a display device. The top GPUs are mostly made by NVIDIA and AMD. GPUs shine best with NVIDIA's graphics cards but recently AMD has significantly improved their GPUs as well.

      <h1>CPUs In Depth</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">When searching for CPUs, you may find them go by a lot of names from each manufacturer, which may be confusing at first but if you look closely you'll find a lot of similarities with just a few tweeks here and there. Let's start with INTEL CPUs for example :</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>i3-5005U</li>
        <li>i5-6600K</li>
        <li>i7-7700HQ</li>
        <li>i9-9750H</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="example.png" class="example">
        <h5 class="w3-padding-16">As explained in the example above, we can find that INTEL Chip labels consists of :</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>A Brand Modifier shows the difference on one or more significant attribute or benefit dimensions. The higher the better but you must take the chip's generation into consideration as well which is clarified in the gen indicator below.</li>
          <li>A Gen Indicator shows the latest and the most developed CPUs in processing and build "also known as the chip's architecture", which means higher generations will be superior.</li>
          <li>SKU Numeric Digits just demonstrates how modified the chip is in the generation itself, it's considered a bit like minor upgrades in the chip's generation.</li>
          <li>A Product Line Suffix may play a big role when understanding what type of processor you want to choose. It can be defined in the table on the right.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="paddingcustom">As for AMD CPUs, It's actually quite similar if we look closely, for example :</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Ryzen 3-3100</li>
          <li>Ryzen 5-5500U</li>
          <li>Ryzen 7-4800H</li>
          <li>Ryzen 9-5900HX</li>
          </ul>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-8">"Note : The (X) Suffix Refers to Xtreme."</h5>

      <h1>GPUs In Depth</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">GPUs can make a lot of hussle when a new generation is released. However, don't rush into buying them as the changes may not be as big as you expect, it solely depends on the programs you use on a daily basis and their needs.</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">If you work with lots of photos or videos, a fast GPU is good for editing software. Plenty of well-known editing software applications take advantage of the added raw power of a GPU, including Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom and Premiere Pro (for serious photo editing). On a computer with a powerful GPU, it takes significantly less time to apply complex filters to photos and special effects to videos. That means less time waiting, more time creating.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">But the upside is not confined to content creation apps. Web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Edge can all tap into a GPU to improve page rendering times. Streaming video from YouTube and Netflix has to be compressed and decompressed before you actually see it. With a GPU, you’ll probably run into fewer stutters or unwanted glitches as that process plays out.</p>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">With understanding what a GPU does, Let's see how can we pick a GPU that fits our needs, we'll be starting off with NVIDIA GPU labels and it consists of :</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A Prefix which may vary between :</br>RTX : Gives premium and the highest performance, Supports <a class="hyperlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray-tracing</a>.</br>GTX : Which provides a good performance with high standards.</br>MX : which has a fine performance and works good with ultra-portable platforms.</li>
        <li>A Generation points to the number of <a class="hyperlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(microarchitecture)">turing architecture</a> of the GPU which gives a more satisfying gaming experience as it is capable of rendering real-time ray-tracing. The higher the turing architecture, the better.</li>
        <li>Pref. Tier changes may be considered minor when observing the other labels, but don't let that fool you as a GPU with a better pref. tier may sometimes have a good impact on your experience without needing to upgrade to a whole different generation.</li>
        <li>A Suffix is really simple, if it has "Ti" at the end of it then it will give a better performance overall.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="paddingcustom">When considering AMD GPUs, No need to panic. It's still honestly quite similar with just a few changes , for example :</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A Prefix which may vary between :</br>RX : Gives the highest performance overall</br>R5 : Which provides a fine performance.</br>R3 : which has a lower performance.</li>
        <li>A Generation points to the series number where it's obvious that the higher series the better, especially the new 5000 series which hands down impressed everyone lately.</li>
        <li>Pref. Tier changes shows you in what series range is the GPU chip.</br>For example : 5500 means that it is a mid tier 5000 series chip.</li>
        <li>A Suffix is still really simple, if it contains "XT" at the end of it then it is the chip's top model.</li>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Companies may even produce their own linup of chips to achieve their goals. As Apple did with their BIONIC Chips, and SAMSUNG did with their Exynos Chips.</p>
